We are working on projects to help promote platform e-commerce and increase e-commerce sales and exposure. When we complete the order task issued by Platform E-Commerce, Platform E-Commerce will pay us a commission, which is our source of income.

you can withdraw the principal amount to your bank account at any time. Deposits will only increase your daily search earnings so it is not an investment.
